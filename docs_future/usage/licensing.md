# Licensing

Out of the box, Manatee.Trello supports 300 downloads and 300 uploads per hour.  If more activity is required for your application, please purchase a license.

Licenses come in three varieties:

- **Open Source Development** - Free licenses may be issued for projects that are developed openly and made free to the public.
- **Single Developer** - For individual developers *US $99 annually*
- **Site-wide** - For multiple developers within a single domain *US $799 annually*

Annual licenses are valid for all major versions released within a calendar year of the date of purchase.

In addition to unlimited calls to Trello, license holder will also receive priority support for any identified bugs and features requests.

Please feel free to [email me](mailto:gregsdennis@yahoo.com) with your licensing needs.
