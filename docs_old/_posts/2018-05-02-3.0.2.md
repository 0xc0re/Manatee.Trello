title: 3.0.2
type: bug fix
---

The following are now read-only as these requests are not supported by Trello.

- `Board.IsPinned`
- `Board.IsStarred`
- `CheckList.Card`

`ICache` changed to take `ICacheable` instead of any object to help support better thread safety.

`Webhook` now implements `ICacheable`
