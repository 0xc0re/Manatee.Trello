## Supported frameworks

Now multi-targets:

- .Net Framework 4.5
- .Net Standard 1.3
- .Net Standard 2.0

## Added asynchronous processing

All methods that perform requests (`Refresh()`, `Delete()`, collection `Add()` methods, etc.) are now async methods and should be awaited.

Request processing no longer occurs in a queue.  Instead, the .Net *async/await* model is used.

## Data access

Getting properties no longer produces requests.  Calling `Refresh()` is required.

Setting properties works as before.

When refreshing entities and collections, more data is downloaded with a single call.  Additionally, all data is used to update any available entities.  This results in fewer required calls.

## Entities

Interfaces have been extracted for all entities to support unit testing.

All properties have been altered to return interfaces rather than concrete types.

## Configuration

Added `RefreshThrottle` to limit successive GET requests.
Added `RemoveDeletedItemsFromCache` to optionally keep deleted entities in the cache.
Removed `ExpiryTime` in conjuction with changes to property getters.

## Libraries

The following libraries have been consolidated into the main library:

- *Manatee.Trello.ManateeJson*
- *Manatee.Trello.WebApi*
- *Manatee.Trello.CustomFields*

The configuration seams for these libraries are still available if alternate solutions are desired.

### Additional changes

Custom fields are now writable.
