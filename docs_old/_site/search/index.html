						"content": "Out of the box, there isn’t much to configure for Manatee.Trello. Just set up authorization, and you’re ready to go. If, however, you’re one to tinker, this page describes the various ways Manatee.Trello can be configured. Authorization The TrelloAuthorization class enables entities to communicate with the Trello API by identifying the application and or a user. It exposes two properties: AppKey identifies the application. Each user has one. Trello suggests that you create a dedicated account for your application to serve as a service account. UserToken identifies a user. This is optional, however without it, only publicly visible data will be accessible, and then only for reading. When supplied, you can also get access to any private data, and the token will specify the type of access. You can read more about authorization in Trello’s documentation. Multiple authorizations In most cases, you’ll only need to set the default keys via the TrelloAuthorization.Default static property. However, in some cases, you may want to access different entities as different users. To support this, all of the entity constructors and factory methods take an optional authorization parameter. Simply create a new TrelloAuthorization instance with the alternate keys, and supply it to one of these methods. Once an entity is created, it will use the same authorization throughout its lifetime. General configuration All other configuration is performed via the TrelloConfiguration static class. Basic behavior Log allows you to supply your own logging solution. The default implementation simply logs to the Debug window. Implement ILog to provide your own solution. ThrowOnTrelloError indicates whether Manatee.Trello will throw a TrelloInteractionException when receiving a bad response from Trello. The default is true. ChangeSubmissionTime specifies how long Manatee.Trello will wait for additional changes to an entity before submitting them to Trello. Setting 0 ms here will result in immediate submission and will disable call aggregation. The default value is 100 ms. RefreshThrottle defines a time during which an entity cannot be refreshed twice. This serves to prevent rapid calls for the same entity. Setting 0 ms here will result in all Refresh() invocations making a call to Trello’s API. The default is 5 seconds. RegisterPowerUp() registers custom power-up implementations, allowing Manatee.Trello to create instances. This is important when enumerating Board.PowerUps. Automatic retries Manatee.Trello can automatically retry calls on failures, delaying a final error until the final retry fails. The following settings configure this behavior. By default, this functionality is disabled. RetryStatusCodes defines which HTTP status codes warrant a retry. MaxRetryCount specifies the number of retries will be performed before finally failing. DelayBetweenRetries indicates a static retry delay to use between each retry. RetryPredicate allows you to implement custom logic. If set, the above values will not be used (unless used by your logic). Components In addition to the behavioral settings above, Manatee.Trello defines several seams where you can supply your own implementations of certain components. Serializer Deserializer allows you to provide your own JSON serializer. For more information, please see the JSON serialier page. The built-in implementation uses Manatee.Json RestClientProvider allows you to provide your own HTTP client. For more information, please see the REST provider page. The built-in implementation uses ASP.Net’s WebClient. NOTE For all you version 2 users, you may recall that these components were supplied in separate Nuget packages. This is no longer the case, as those packages have been incorporated as of version 3 to serve as default implementations. This means that you no longer have to set these properties as part of your initial configuration."

						"content": "Download the package The first thing to do is download and install the Nuget package. This can be performed from the Nuget Package Manager command line or through the Visual Studio UI. &gt; Install-Package Manatee.Trello Configuration There is very little configuration that is required to get Manatee.Trello going out of the box. NOTE For users of Manatee.Trello versions 1 or 2, the REST provider and JSON serializer have been integrated into the main Nuget package and are initialized as the default services. These no longer need to be configured. The only values that must be provided are for authorization, which you can read about later in this document. Additional configuration is discussed on the Configuration page. Reading data In Manatee.Trello, entities can be created using one of two methods: via the factory var factory = new TrelloFactory(); var board = factory.Board(\"&lt;board ID&gt;\") via a constructor var board = new Board(\"&lt;board ID&gt;\"); The factory returns interfaces and is ideal for dependency injection scenarios and for supporting unit testability. Before any of the data is available, the Refresh() method must be called. This is an asynchronous method that should be awaited. NOTE In previous versions, the data would be automatically downloaded, which was a synchronous and blocking process. The approach was abandoned to support an async await model as well as to give the client more control over when data is downloaded. The only exception to this is the Id property on boards and cards (these can be instantiated via shorter IDs, and the system will block to resolve the full ID). If you don’t need any of the data from the board itself, but you just want the collection of lists, you can call Refresh() directly on the Lists collection. Otherwise, by default, the lists will be downloaded as part of the board refresh as well. While this results in rather large data transfers per call, it reduces the number of required calls greatly which provides an overall performance increase. Customizing the download Most of the entities define a flag-enabled Fields enumeration and a DownloadedFields static property. This property determines what data is downloaded when the Refresh() method is called. For example, if you don’t care about downloading the actions or the URL for a board, you can use the following to disable download for these properties: Board.DownloadedFields &amp;= ~Board.Fields.Actions &amp; ~Board.Fields.Url; To re-enable these fields for download, simply invert the statement: Board.DownloadedFields |= Board.Fields.Actions | Board.Fields.Url; By default, all of the data is downloaded for all entities. The exceptions are: Boards don’t download members (in favor of memberships) or cards (in favor of getting cards when refreshing lists) Organizations don’t download members (in favor of memberships) If an entity has already been downloaded and cached, and new data for it is retrieved as part of an unrelated refresh (e.g. refreshing a card may also download data for the list which contains it), the new data will be merged into the existing entity. Manatee.Trello attempts to use all of the data provided by the API to ensure that information is as up-to-date as possible. Writing data Sending data back to Trello is quite easy. Many edits are updating fields, such as the description on a card or the name of a board. For tasks like this, you only need to set the property. This will trigger an asynchronous process to submit the new data to Trello. When a property is set, a timer starts, the duration of which is determined by TrelloConfiguration.ChangeSubmissionTime. Once the timer expires, it sends the change. But there’s a bonus: if another change for the same entity is made (i.e. setting another property), the timer is reset. When the timer expires, all changes are sent as a single request. If you need to, you can wait for property changes to be sent to Trello by calling await TrelloProcessor.Flush(). This will ensure that the updates are sent before continuing. Other writes are generally deletions or creations. When you need to delete an entity, simply call its Delete() method. Done. Creating entities can be accomplished via methods on various collections. For instance, to add a card to a list, do this: var newCard = await list.Cards.Add(\"a new card\"); There are usually overloads for the Add() methods. See the API documentation pages of this wiki for more information on what calls are available. A note about positioning Several of the entities, like cards and lists, can be sorted or otherwise have their order changed. This is controlled by the Position property. Trello records an entity’s position using a floating point number system. If the user moves card A between cards B and C, Trello takes the numeric position values of B and C, averages them, and assigns that value to card A. Searching for entities Trello has the ability to search any board, organization, or card for certain text. This ability is exposed through the Search object. With this object, you can specify the search query, the entities in which to search, which types of entities to return, and the maximum number of each type of entity to return. The following code searches a specified board for a maximum of 100 cards which contain the text “trello” and outputs the number of cards. string boardId = \"[a board ID]\"; string query = \"trello\"; var board = factory.Board(boardId); var search = factory.Search(query, 100, SearchModelType.Cards, new IQueryable[] {board}); await search.Refresh(); Console.Writeline(search.Cards.Count()); NOTE All collection objects implement IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, so the Count() method is the Enumerable.Count() method defined in System.Linq. While the context list can contain any object, only the first 24 each of boards, organizations, and cards will be included in the search. This is a limitation from Trello, not this wrapper. Also, the SearchModelType values may be combined using the bit-wise OR operator |. You can also build queries using the SearchQuery class. This class contains a number of static methods which will produce an instance specifying what you want to search for. There are also extension methods which allow you to append search criteria. For example, the following code will search for: Cards On a specific board Assigned to Member.Me Containing the text “trello” in a comment, and Due in the next week string boardId = \"[a board ID]\"; var query = new SearchQuery().Member(Member.Me) .AndTextInComments(\"trello\") .AndDueWithinWeek(); var board = new Board(boardId); var results = new Search(query, 100, SearchModelType.Cards, new IQueryable[] {board}); Console.Writeline(results.Cards.Count()); This query is equivalent to the string \"@me comment:trello due:week\". See Trello’s blog post for more information on search parameters. All of the special parameters listed in this post have been implemented. NOTE When creating entities, it will take some time for the new items to be indexed on the Trello servers. During this time, these entities will not be returned in searches. This may also affect searching for entities that have recently changed. Authorization An application key and authentication token are string values that enable Trello to recognize who is requesting access and through which application they are doing so. All required information regarding obtaining these values may be found on Trello’s developer documentation pages. Application key The application key is stored in TrelloAuthorization.AppKey. This value is tied to a specific user. Trello advises that this should be a service account created specifically for the application. Alone, the application key grants read access to any publicly-readable data. To enable write access or access to protected data, an authentication token must be provided as well. Authentication token The authentication token is store in TrelloAuthorization.UserToken and will grant access as approved by the user who issued it. Users have the power to grant read, write, and admin privileges to a token for a specific duration or indefinitely. NOTE A authentication is a string, whereas the Token object will provide information on an authentication token, including the name of the application that requested it and the member who created it. Manatee.Trello can use multiple authorizations simultaneously. This can be extremely useful when bridging two systems or user profiles. By using multiple authorizations, you can be consistent between the two systems (the correct users make cards or add comments, etc.). To enable this, simply create a new instance of the TrelloAuthorization class and pass it into the factory method for your entity. The authorization will be retained throughout the lifetime of that entity. var auth = new TrelloAuthorization { AppKey = \"[your application key]\", UserToken = \"[your user token]\" } var card = new Card(\"[your card ID]\", auth); This authorization parameter is optional. The entity will use TrelloAuthorization.Default in its absence. Error handling Manatee.Trello will pass on any errors returned by Trello’s API wrapped in a TrelloInteractionException. For entities which feature a Delete() method, once Delete() has been called that entity essentially becomes “dead.” That is, all of the data which has been already downloaded will remain available however updates will have no effect, and the entity will be permanently removed from Trello’s servers."

						"category": "",
						"url": " /1-main/power-ups/",
						"content": "Trello PowerUps enable users to leverage custom functionality to make their board more powerful. To support this new feature and allow anyone to create their own power-up, they expose only the raw data. It’s up to the power-up creator to interpret and use the data. As a result, each power-up is unique, making a generic Manatee.Trello power-up implementation impossible. Due to this, power-up implementations will be published separately from the primary Nuget package. NOTE Custom Fields, Voting, and, Card Aging are considered power-ups by Trello, however their functionalities are integrated into the API. Therefore they are also integrated into Manatee.Trello. NOTE Prior to its integration into the primary API, Custom Fields was published as a separate Nuget package. It has been integrated as of version 3. This section describes the base functionality in Manatee.Trello for implementing power-ups. Although it’s no longer a power-up this section still uses the Custom Fields power-up implementation as an example. I’ll update the wiki when I create a new power-up. Really, nothing about the particulars of implementing a power-up have changed, so the example is still valid. Data organization Trello exposes data in two forms: the power-up definition and the associated data. Power-up definitions Each board determines the set of active power-ups. Boards under free accounts can have only a single power-up active at a time, while paid accounts can have multiple. Definitions are available on the board via the Board.PowerUps property. Unless a specific implementation has been registered (see Creating your own power-up) this will return only UnknownPowerUp instances. Once a power-up is registered, it will start returning that type of power-up if it’s available. A power-up definition specifies the power-up global ID (unique across all boards), the name, and a URL to a JSON object containing more meta-data regarding the power-up. Power-up data Power-ups can enhance the functionality of boards and cards. Each of these objects in Manatee.Trello exposes a PowerUpData property that can be used to get a collection of data objects (PowerUpData) that reveals the enhanced data for that item. (Trello says that power-ups can enhance organizations, too, but they don’t have that exposed. The Organization.PowerUpData property will therefore likely throw an exception. I have it there for completeness.) Each data object defines the specific ID for that instance, the ID of the power-up which defined it, and the value (as a JSON string) of the data. This is as implementation-specific as Manatee.Trello can be. Making use of this data requires details very specific to a particular power-up. Creating your own power-up The Custom Fields power-up has already been implemented. It will serve as our example. Note that each implementation will function slightly differently, but this should give you a general idea of how to proceed. To do this, you’ll need to get a hold of the JSON response values directly from the Trello API. Implementing the definition Every power-up implementation is required to define its unique ID and a constructor that takes an IJsonPowerUp object and a TrelloAuthorization object. All power-ups should also register themselves with the TrelloConfiguration static class (it makes things easier for the client). Note that these do not have to be public members. The PowerUpBase abstract class has been provided by Manatee.Trello to get you started and provide some basic power-up functionality. public class CustomFieldsPowerUp : PowerUpBase { internal const string PluginId = \"56d5e249a98895a9797bebb9\"; private static bool _isRegistered; private CustomFieldsPowerUp(IJsonPowerUp json, TrelloAuthorization auth) : base(json, auth) {} internal static void Register() { if (!_isRegistered) { _isRegistered = true; TrelloConfiguration.RegisterPowerUp(PluginId, (j, a) =&gt; new CustomFieldsPowerUp(j, a)); } } } That’s about it for the definition. Now, the Board.PowerUps property will return an instance of this class (instead of UnknownPowerUp) if the power-up is active. But just having the power-up definition doesn’t really help much, so let’s take a look at getting some data. Implementing the data We start by looking at the data that is returned when we call all of the power-up-related properties. NOTE This data assumes that Custom Fields is the only power-up active on the board. Otherwise, there will be an entry for each plugin. NOTE To create this data, I had to add the Custom Fields plugin to a board, define a field of each type, and then apply data to a card for each field. Board.PowerUps [ { \"id\": \"56d5e249a98895a9797bebb9\", \"name\": \"Custom Fields\", \"public\": true, \"url\": \"https: card-fields.trello.services manifest.json\" } ] Board.PowerUpData [ { \"id\": \"57f4bfeccccb2628768688be\", \"idPlugin\": \"56d5e249a98895a9797bebb9\", \"scope\": \"board\", \"idModel\": \"51478f6469fd3d9341001dae\", \"value\": \"{\\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"n\\\":\\\"MyNumberField\\\",\\\"t\\\":1,\\\"b\\\":1,\\\"id\\\":\\\"VHHdzCU0-ROR8bF\\\"},{\\\"n\\\":\\\"MyDateField\\\",\\\"t\\\":0,\\\"id\\\":\\\"VHHdzCU0-ITIYAU\\\"},{\\\"n\\\":\\\"MyDateField\\\",\\\"t\\\":3,\\\"id\\\":\\\"VHHdzCU0-dE8xFw\\\"},{\\\"n\\\":\\\"MyCheckboxField\\\",\\\"t\\\":2,\\\"id\\\":\\\"VHHdzCU0-o8TMjq\\\"},{\\\"n\\\":\\\"MyDropdownField\\\",\\\"t\\\":4,\\\"o\\\":[\\\"One\\\",\\\"Two\\\",\\\"Three\\\",\\\"Text\\\"],\\\"id\\\":\\\"VHHdzCU0-Y1ylHE\\\"}],\\\"btn\\\":\\\"Metadata\\\"}\", \"access\": \"shared\" } ] Card.PowerUpData [ { \"id\": \"57f4bffd0a0a813388367a0b\", \"idPlugin\": \"56d5e249a98895a9797bebb9\", \"scope\": \"card\", \"idModel\": \"51478f6ce7d2d11751005681\", \"value\": \"{\\\"fields\\\":{\\\"VHHdzCU0-ROR8bF\\\":\\\"4\\\",\\\"VHHdzCU0-ITIYAU\\\":\\\"nothing to see here\\\",\\\"VHHdzCU0-dE8xFw\\\":\\\"2016-11-15T12:00:00+13:00\\\",\\\"VHHdzCU0-o8TMjq\\\":true,\\\"VHHdzCU0-Y1ylHE\\\":3}}\", \"access\": \"shared\" } ] If you stare at this data long enough, and through squinty eyes, you’ll be able to see the pattern: The Board.PowerUps property give us the data to build the CustomFieldsPowerUp instance from the last section. The Board.PowerUpData property defines the fields and the text that appears on the button inside a card. Each field has and ID (id), a name (n), and a data type (t). Dropdown fields also have a property that defines the available options (o). The Card.PowerUpData property defines the field data for that card. Note that numbers, text, and dates all come in as text, which booleans show as bool and dropdown data appears as an integer indicating the index of the selected option. So all we have to do is link up the field definitions with the field data. To start, we model the data. this models the Board.PowerUpData data. public class CustomFieldsSettings { public string ButtonText { get; private set; } public IEnumerable&lt;CustomFieldDefinition&gt; Fields { get; private set; } ... I have some JSON serialization details as well. } This models each field definition. public class CustomFieldDefinition : IJsonSerializable { internal string Id { get; private set; } public string Name { get; private set; } public FieldType Type { get; private set; } public bool ShowBadge { get; private set; } public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; DropdownOptions { get; private set; } ... more JSON serialization stuff. } This models the data for a field. public class CustomFieldData { internal string Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; internal set; } public FieldType Type { get; internal set; } public string Value { get; internal set; } } To get the data (in a convenient fashion) we create a couple extension methods: one that works on boards and one on cards. public static class CustomFieldExtensions { private static readonly JsonSerializer Serializer = new JsonSerializer(); public static CustomFieldsSettings CustomFieldsSettings(this Board board) { CustomFieldsPowerUp.Register(); var data = board.PowerUpData.FirstOrDefault(d =&gt; d.PluginId == CustomFieldsPowerUp.PluginId); if (data == null) return null; var json = JsonValue.Parse(data.Value); var settings = Serializer.Deserialize&lt;CustomFieldsSettings&gt;(json); return settings; } public static IEnumerable&lt;CustomFieldData&gt; CustomFields(this Card card) { CustomFieldsPowerUp.Register(); var data = card.PowerUpData.FirstOrDefault(d =&gt; d.PluginId == CustomFieldsPowerUp.PluginId); if (data == null) return null; This will return null if the power-up isn't registered. var powerUp = card.Board.TryGetPowerUp(); if (powerUp == null) return null; var json = JsonValue.Parse(data.Value); var fieldData = json.Object.TryGetObject(\"fields\").Select(d =&gt; new CustomFieldData { Id = d.Key, Value = d.Value.Type == JsonValueType.String ? d.Value.String : d.Value.ToString() }); var fieldSettings = card.Board.CustomFieldsSettings(); fieldData = fieldSettings.Fields.Join(fieldData, f =&gt; f.Id, d =&gt; d.Id, (f, d) =&gt; { d.Name = f.Name; d.Type = f.Type; return d; }); return fieldData; } } NOTE The TryGetPowerUp() method is an extension on the board that caches the power-up per board. It just helps reduces the number of calls. Now the client can simply call card.CustomFields() to get all of the custom field data. Ideally other power-up implementations will follow the same basic concept: creating a PowerUpBase derivative and extension methods to access the data. The hard part is figuring out the data."

						"content": "You can instruct the library to use a custom JSON serializer. The default serializer uses Manatee.Json. This is my own JSON serializer, and it’s the best… because it’s mine. NOTE Once upon a time, I had implemented a serializer based on Newtonsoft’s Json.Net. But due to several complexities of the Trello API contract, I didn’t feel I was enough of a Json.Net wizard to tackle these, so I dropped it. ANOTHER NOTE If you consider yourself strong in the ways of Newtonsoft’s Json.Net, please feel free to tackle this library and publish it yourself. If you prefer to use a different JSON serializer, the method is similar to that of using your own REST provider. In the Manatee.Trello.Json namespace, you will find a bunch of interfaces, all of which must be implemented. Two will be wrappers for the serializer itself, one will be a factory responsible for creating instances of all of the DTO interfaces, while the others will be concrete implementations for the various object types which Manatee.Trello requests through the REST provider. ISerializer IDeserializer - A distinction between serializer and deserializer functionality has been made for ultimate compatiblity. In most cases, they will be the same object, however exposing this functionality in this way allows Manatee.Trello to support the case that your preferred serializer uses separate objects or that you prefer different libraries to provide this functionality. (And for you software design nuts out there, it support Interface Segregation: the I in SOLID.) IJsonFactory - All of the objects in Manatee.Trello use the JSON objects for data contexts. This factory provides a mechanism for the internals to create instances of those JSON objects. IPickAnEntity - There are quite a few entity interfaces for which you will need to provide functionality. Furthermore, the serializer and deserializer will be called using these interfaces, so you’ll need to ensure that your implementation of IDeserializer is configured properly to create instances of your entity implementations when the entity interface is supplied as the type. (For example, if IJsonCard is requested by Manatee.Trello, your deserializer will need to know to create an instance of your MyJsonCard class which implements IJsonCard.) Once all of the interfaces have been implemented, you can configure Manatee.Trello to use your serializer by setting the Serializer and Deserializer static properties on the TrelloServiceConfiguration static class. public class MyJsonSerializerWrapper : ISerializer, IDeserializer { ... } public class MyJsonFactory : IJsonFactory { ... } public static void Main() { ... var serializer = new MyJsonSerializerWrapper(); TrelloConfiguration.Serializer = serializer; TrelloConfiguration.Deserializer = serializer; TrelloConfiguration.JsonFactory = new MyJsonFactory(); ... } To aid in deciding which properties should and should not be serialized, three non-functional attributes have been created and placed on all of the JSON interface properties: JsonDeserializeAttribute - Indicates that the property should be deserialized if a value is present. JsonSerializeAttribute - Indicates that a property should be serialized if a value is present. Also exposes an IsRequired boolean property to indicate whether Trello requires this property. JsonSpecialSerializationAttribute - Indicates that Trello expects special serialization for a given property. Refer to the Trello API documentation for more information regarding these properties. Lastly, many of the DTO interaces implement IAcceptId. These DTOs may be received as mere the entity’s ID string instead of the entire body. When a string is received, it must be deserialized as the full object with only the Id property populated. When an object is received, deserialize all applicable properties and set the ValidForMerge property to true. In this way, Manatee.Trello will know that this DTO can be used as a new data source for that entity. That’s it. Manatee.Trello will now use your JSON serializer through the wrappers you have provided."

						"content": "By default, Manatee.Trello uses a REST client backed by ASP.Net’s WebClient class. If you would like to use a different client, you will have to build the provider yourself. The Manatee.Trello.Rest namespace contains a number of interfaces which must be implemented in order to use your preferred REST provider. IRestClient - This interface defines methods used to make RESTful calls. Its implementation will serve as a wrapper for your preferred REST provider. IRestClientProvider - This interface defines methods required to create an instance of IRestClient. Within your implementation, you can maintain a single instance of the client object, if the client supports it, but Manatee.Trello will request the client object for each request. IRestRequest - This interface defines properties and methods required to make RESTful requests. Its implementation serves as a wrapper for your REST provider’s request objects. IRestRequestProvider - This interface defines methods required to generate IRequest objects used to make RESTful calls. Its implementation will be exposed by your IRestClientProvider implementation. IRestResponse - Defines properties required for objects returned by RESTful calls. Its implmentation serves as a wrapper for your REST provider’s response objects. IRestResponse&lt;T&gt; - Extends IRestResponse to add a typed Data property. Once you have your implementations, set the RestRequestProvider property on the IRestClientProvider implementation to the IRestRequestProvider implementation, then set the RestClientProvider static property on the TrelloConfiguration static class to your IRestClientProvider implementation. public class MyRestRequestProvider : IRestRequestProvider { ... } public class MyRestClientProvider : IRestClientProvider { ... } public static void Main() { ... var clientProvider = new MyRestClientProvider(); var requestProvider = new MyRestRequestProvider(); clientProvider.RestRequestProvider = requestProvider; TrelloConfiguration.RestClientProvider = clientProvider; ... } That’s it. Manatee.Trello will now call your REST provider through the wrappers you have provided. NOTE Your REST provider should allow using a custom JSON serializer. It is suggested that you code your IRestClientProvider implementation to use the serializer defined by the TrelloConfiguration stataic class. The default serializer implementation is backed by Manatee.Json. See the JSON Serializer section of this wiki for more details on using a custom JSON serializer. Error handling Manatee.Trello is designed to expect exceptions from the REST provider it is given. This means that your REST client wrapper implementation (or the client itself) should throw exceptions when receiving invalid data."

						"title": "Webhooks",
						"category": "",
						"url": " /1-main/webhooks/",
						"content": "As an alternative to refreshing entities manually, you have the option of using webhooks to listen for notifications from Trello. Webhooks are basically subcriptions to entities. When an entity is altered outside of Manatee.Trello, an HTML POST message will be sent by Trello to a URI that the developer specifies which contains an Action describing what occurred. Manatee.Trello can interpret these Actions and apply any changes to affected entities. It should be noted that this does not disable manually refreshing entities. Creating webhooks You can create webhooks via either the Webhook&lt;T&gt; constructor or a method on the entity factory which takes an object implementing the ICanWebhook interface. Like the other entities, you can also download the information for a webhook that already exists by passing the webhook’s ID. var member = factory.Member(\"myusername\"); var webhook = factory.Webook&lt;Member&gt;(member, \"http: myurl.com inbox \"); The URI which is passed in must be set up to receive POST messages. Within the controller, extract the message body as a string, and pass it to the TrelloProcessor.ProcessNotification() static method. Manatee.Trello will find the entity (if it’s been downloaded already) and update it. NOTE In the example above, the member is cached upon creation. If a message is received for an entity which has not been downloaded, there is no change. IMPORTANT When you create a webhook, Trello will make a HEAD request to callbackURL you provide to verify that it is a valid URL. Failing to respond to the HEAD request will result in the webhook failing to be created. Working with webhooks There are several properties on the Webhook entity that you can use to modify its behavior. CallbackUrl - Changes the callback URL to which Trello will send notification messages. Description - Changes an informational description of the webhook. Entity - Changes the entity to which the webhook listens. It should be noted that since the Webhook&lt;T&gt; class is generic, it will be strongly typed to the same kind of entity for which it was created. This is a requirement imposed by Manatee.Trello, not Trello’s API. IsActive - Exposes the ability to temporarily disable notifications for the webhook. When disabled, Trello will not send notifications. Webhooks also expose a Delete() method which will permanently delete the webhook from Trello."

These values can be found in the field's definition, accessible through the board. While the definition is accessible through the field, Trello doesn't send the options during this call.

						"title": "Configuration",
						"category": "",
						"url": " /4-v2/Configuration/",
						"content": "There are several ways that one can configure Manatee.Trello. This configuration is exposed via the TrelloConfiguration static class. These options include: Log - This allows Manatee.Trello to log communications and exceptions. More information can be found on the Logging section below. Cache - Every object caches itself on creation. Manatee.Trello utilizes this behavior to prevent creation of two instances which represent the same object. (It should be noted that multiple instances can be explicitly created, however.) ThrowOnTrelloError - This sets behavior on whether the system will throw an exception on errors received from Trello or merely log them. ExpiryTime - This sets how long entities will consider their data valid. After this time the data is considered stale and any access to the object will trigger a call to refresh the data. ChangeSubmissionTime - This value defines an idle time for entity changes. Once this idle time is met, any changes will be submitted. This allows multiple changes to be submitted with a single call. In addition to the TrelloConfiguration static class, there is also a TrelloProcessor static class which manages how the request processor thread behaves when the application is shutting down. ConcurrentCallCount - Acts as a throttle on the number of concurrent API calls that can be made. The default is 1. Flush() - Signals the processor to flush any pending requests. Will block until all requests have been processed. This can be used at any time. This should be called at the end of the application to ensure that all requests are fulfilled. Obsolete and unused as of v1.9.0 WaitForPendingRequests - true initializes the processor thread to start in the foreground, which will hold the application open until the Shutdown() method is called. false will allow the application to close immediately, but may leave some requests unsent. The default is false. Obsolete as of v1.9.0 Shutdown() - Signals the processor thread that the application is closing. When this occurs, it calls for all requests to be added to the queue so that they can be processed, shortcutting the idle time configured by TrelloConfiguration.ChangeSubmissionTime. As of v1.9.0, this method simply forwards its call to Flush(). See Request Processing on the Getting Started page for more information on how requests are processed. Default configuration Manatee.Trello will provide fallback implementations for the cache and log. The cache is a simple, thread-safe, list-based cache, and the log only writes to the Debug window. These will be used whenever these properties are set to null. Logging All logging is provided by the ILog implementation stored in the Log property of the TrelloConfiguration class. By default, logging is provided by an internal implementation which forwards all logging messages to the Debug window. The ILog interface exposes the following methods: Debug - Logs a debug message. Info - Logs an informational message. Error - Logs an exception with an option to throw the exception once logged. This interface must be implemented to use the logging solution of your preference. If, at run-time, this logging implementation is removed from the TrelloConfiguration class (by setting the Log property to null), it will reset to the default implementation."

					"4-v2-getting-started": {
						"id": "4-v2-getting-started",
						"title": "Getting Started",
						"category": "",
						"url": " /4-v2/Getting-started/",
						"content": "Configuration Before entities can be created, Manatee.Trello must be configured using the TrelloConfiguration, TrelloAuthorization, and TrelloProcessor classes. To do this, several components will be required: Application Key &amp; User Token - These identify the application and provide access to Trello data. The user token is not explicitly required, but without it you will only gain read-only access to publicly available information. JSON Serializer Deserializer Factory - The serializer &amp; deserializer facilitate object data translation between Trello’s servers and Manatee.Trello. The factory allows Manatee.Trello to create JSON objects internally. More information can be found on the Json Serializer page. REST Provider - This facilitates communication between Trello’s servers and Manatee.Trello. More information can be found on the Rest Provider page. The TrelloConfiguration static class also exposes several other configuration options. These can be found on the Configuration page. The code below gives an example of configuring Manatee.Trello. var serializer = new ManateeSerializer(); TrelloConfiguration.Serializer = serializer; TrelloConfiguration.Deserializer = serializer; TrelloConfiguration.JsonFactory = new ManateeFactory(); TrelloConfiguration.RestClientProvider = new WebApiClientProvider(); TrelloAuthorization.Default.AppKey = \"[your application key]\"; TrelloAuthorization.Default.UserToken = \"[your user token]\"; Reading data The Trello API requires all users to supply an application key (AppKey) to access any data. Supplying only an AppKey enables read-only access publicly-visible data. For example, to find all cards which exist on a public board, simply instantiate a Board object by supplying the board’s ID and access the Cards property. TrelloAuthorization.Default.AppKey = \"[your application key]\"; var board = new Board(\"[your board id]\"); var cards = board.Cards; Tip: You can filter most collection types using the Filter() extension method. For example, you can use board.Cards.Filter(CardFilter.Closed) to get all archived cards for the board. For consistency, the extension method will return a new collection object. It should be noted that no API calls have yet been made. It’s not until we actually enumerate the cards that the data is accessed. If we had instead accessed one of the non-collection properties on the board, a call would have been made to download the board’s data. This would be a separate call than the one used to download the cards. So if we were to print out the board’s name and all of the names of the cards, a total of two calls will be made. TrelloAuthorization.Default.AppKey = \"[your application key]\"; var boardId = \"[your board id]\"; var board = new Board(boardId); Console.Writeline(board); foreach(var card in board.Cards) { Console.Writeline(card); } NOTE: Some of the objects on Trello (most notably cards) have a shortLink ID. This is visible in the URL when viewing a card in a browser. These IDs can be passed into the constructors of Manatee.Trello objects. However a call will be made when accessing the Id property on these object. This call is skipped when accessing the Id property for an object which has been instantiated using the full 24-character ID. Writing data Writing (changing data, adding cards, etc.) is enabled by additionally supplying a user token (UserToken). When a UserToken is supplied, access is granted based on the user who supplied the UserToken. NOTE When a UserToken is created, various levels of access are granted. It may be that the specific UserToken was created with read-only access. But even in these cases, you can still read the member’s private data. The following code adds a card to a list then assigns the first member of the board to the card. TrelloAuthorization.Default.AppKey = \"[your application key]\"; TrelloAuthorization.Default.UserToken = \"[your user token]\"; string listId = \"[a list ID]\"; var list = new List(listId); var member = list.Board.Members.First(); var card = list.Cards.Add(\"new card\"); card.Members.Add(member); There are a total of four calls being made here: Downloading the list to access the board. Downloading the members on the board. Adding a card to the list. Assigning a the member to the card. Searching for entities Trello has the ability to search any board, organization, or card for certain text. This ability is exposed through the Search object. With this object, you can specify the search query, the entities in which to search, which types of entities to return, and the maximum number of each type of entity to return. The following code searches a specified board for a maximum of 100 cards which contain the text “trello” and outputs the number of cards. string boardId = \"[a board ID]\"; string query = \"trello\"; var board = new Board(boardId); var results = new Search(query, 100, SearchModelType.Cards, new IQueryable[] {board}); Console.Writeline(results.Cards.Count()); NOTE: All collection objects implement IEnumerable, so the `Count()` method is the `Enumerable.Count()` method defined in System.Linq. While the context list can contain any object, only the first 24 each of boards, organizations, and cards will be included in the search. This is a limitation from Trello, not this wrapper. Also, the SearchModelType values may be combined using the bit-wise OR operator ‘|’. You can also build queries using the SearchFor class. This class contains a number of static methods which will produce an instance specifying what you want to search for. There are also extension methods which allow you to append search criteria. For example, the following code will search for: Cards On a specific board Assigned to Member.Me Containing the text \"trello\" in a comment, and Due in the next week string boardId = \"[a board ID]\"; var query = SearchFor.Member(Member.Me) .AndTextInComments(\"trello\") .AndDueWithinWeek(); var board = new Board(boardId); var results = new Search(query, 100, SearchModelType.Cards, new IQueryable[] {board}); Console.Writeline(results.Cards.Count()); NOTE: All of the methods available on SearchFor are also created as extension methods which allow the chaining above. The extension methods all start with And. This query produces the string \"@me comment:trello due:week\". See Trello’s blog post for more information on search parameters. All of these have been implemented. More on authorization The AppKey and UserToken must be supplied by existing users of Trello. All required information regarding obtaining these values may be found on Trello’s developer documentation pages. In short: The AppKey is tied to a specific user (can be a service account created for the application). The AppKey is required and will grant read access to all data which is visible to the user who issued it. The UserToken is optional and will grant access as approved by the user who issued it. Note: A UserToken is a string, whereas the Token object will provide information on a UserToken, including the name of the application that requested it and the member who created it. New functionality as of v1.3.0 Manatee.Trello can use multiple authorizations simultaneously. This can be extremely useful when bridging two systems or user profiles. By using multiple authorizations, you can be consistent between the two systems (the correct users make cards or add comments, etc.). To enable this, simply create a new instance of teh TrelloAuthorization class and pass it into the constructor of your entity. The authorization will be retained throughout the lifetime of that entity. var auth = new TrelloAuthorization { AppKey = \"[your application key]\", UserToken = \"[your user token]\" } var card = new Card(\"[your card i]\", auth); This authorization parameter is optional. The entity will use TrelloAuthorization.Default in its absence. Error handling Manatee.Trello will pass on any errors returned by Trello’s API wrapped in a TrelloInteractionException. For entities which feature a Delete() method, once Delete() has been called that entity essentially becomes “dead.” That is, all of the data which has been already downloaded will remain available however updates will have no effect. Request Processing Prior to v1.9.0, Manatee.Trello maintained a dedicated thread on which all API requests would be queued, then each request would be fulfilled in turn. This had the effect of blocking all threads waiting for responses. As of v1.9.0, Manatee.Trello supports sending API requests concurrently, with some limitations. Each thread that needs a request fulfilled will operate in a synchronous manner. So while a single thread may be blocked temporarily while it is waiting for a response from the server, multiple threads are processed in parallel. The number of concurrent requests that can be processed is controlled by the TrelloProcessor.ConcurrentCallCount static property. This property has a default of 1, which will result in similar behavior to that of the pre-v1.9.0 libraries. Setting this to a higher value will allow more calls to be made concurrently, effectively throttled at this number. Because Manatee.Trello has no way of keeping the application alive if there are pending requests (threads will be terminated when the application closes), TrelloProcessor also exposes the Flush() static method. This should be used at the end of the appliation to ensure that all requests are fulfilled. This method may also be called at any time if the client sees a need. Also, as of v1.11.0, there is also a TrelloProcessor.CancelPendingRequests() method which will stub responses for any calls still pending, effectively cancelling them."

					"4-v2-powerups": {
						"id": "4-v2-powerups",
						"title": "Power-Ups",
						"category": "",
						"url": " /4-v2/PowerUps/",
						"content": "Some time ago, Trello announced a new feature that enables users to leverage custom functionality to make their board more powerful. They called this feature PowerUps. To support this new feature and allow anyone to create their own power-up, they expose only the raw data. It’s up to the power-up creator to organize and use the data. As a result, each power-up can be uniquely organized, making a generic Manatee.Trello power-up implementation impossible. Due to this, power-up implementations will be published separately from the primary Nuget package. Current implementations include: Custom Fields more to come… This section describes the base functionality in Manatee.Trello for implementing power-ups, using the Custom Fields power-up (provided by Manatee.Trello.CustomFields) as an example. Data organization Trello exposes data in two forms: the power-up definition and the associated data. Power-up definitions Each board determines the set of active power-ups. Boards under free accounts can have only a single power-up active at a time, while paid accounts can have multiple. Definitions are available on the board via the Board.PowerUps property. Unless a specific implementation has been registered (see Creating your own power-up) this will return only UnknownPowerUp instances. Once a power-up is registered, it will start returning that type of power-up if it’s available. A power-up definition specifies the power-up global ID (unique across all boards), the name, and a URL to a JSON object containing more meta-data regarding the power-up. Power-up data Power-ups can enhance the functionality of boards and cards. Each of these objects in Manatee.Trello exposes a PowerUpData property that can be used to get a collection of data objects (PowerUpData) that reveals the enhanced data for that item. (Trello says that power-ups can enhance organizations, too, but they don’t have that exposed. The Organization.PowerUpData property will therefore likely throw an exception. I have it there for completeness.) Each data object defines the specific ID for that instance, the ID of the power-up which defined it, and the value (as a JSON string) of the data. This is as implementation-specific as Manatee.Trello can be. Making use of this data requires details very specific to a particular power-up. Creating your own power-up The Custom Fields power-up has already been implemented. It will serve as our example. Note that each implementation will function slightly differently, but this should give you a general idea of how to proceed. To do this, you’ll need to get a hold of the JSON response values directly from the Trello API. Implementing the definition Every power-up implementation is required to define its unique ID and a constructor that takes an IJsonPowerUp object and a TrelloAuthorization object. All power-ups should also register themselves with the TrelloConfiguration static class (it makes things easier for the client). Note that these do not have to be public members. The PowerUpBase abstract class has been provided by Manatee.Trello to get you started and provide some basic power-up functionality. public class CustomFieldsPowerUp : PowerUpBase { internal const string PluginId = \"56d5e249a98895a9797bebb9\"; private static bool _isRegistered; private CustomFieldsPowerUp(IJsonPowerUp json, TrelloAuthorization auth) : base(json, auth) {} internal static void Register() { if (!_isRegistered) { _isRegistered = true; TrelloConfiguration.RegisterPowerUp(PluginId, (j, a) =&gt; new CustomFieldsPowerUp(j, a)); } } } That’s about it for the definition. Now, the Board.PowerUps property will return an instance of this class (instead of UnknownPowerUp) if the power-up is active. But just having the power-up definition doesn’t really help much, so let’s take a look at getting some data. Implementing the data We start by looking at the data that is returned when we call all of the power-up-related properties. NOTE This data assumes that Custom Fields is the only power-up active on the board. Otherwise, there will be an entry for each plugin. NOTE To create this data, I had to add the Custom Fields plugin to a board, define a field of each type, and then apply data to a card for each field. Board.PowerUps [ { \"id\": \"56d5e249a98895a9797bebb9\", \"name\": \"Custom Fields\", \"public\": true, \"url\": \"https: card-fields.trello.services manifest.json\" } ] Board.PowerUpData [ { \"id\": \"57f4bfeccccb2628768688be\", \"idPlugin\": \"56d5e249a98895a9797bebb9\", \"scope\": \"board\", \"idModel\": \"51478f6469fd3d9341001dae\", \"value\": \"{\\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"n\\\":\\\"MyNumberField\\\",\\\"t\\\":1,\\\"b\\\":1,\\\"id\\\":\\\"VHHdzCU0-ROR8bF\\\"},{\\\"n\\\":\\\"MyDateField\\\",\\\"t\\\":0,\\\"id\\\":\\\"VHHdzCU0-ITIYAU\\\"},{\\\"n\\\":\\\"MyDateField\\\",\\\"t\\\":3,\\\"id\\\":\\\"VHHdzCU0-dE8xFw\\\"},{\\\"n\\\":\\\"MyCheckboxField\\\",\\\"t\\\":2,\\\"id\\\":\\\"VHHdzCU0-o8TMjq\\\"},{\\\"n\\\":\\\"MyDropdownField\\\",\\\"t\\\":4,\\\"o\\\":[\\\"One\\\",\\\"Two\\\",\\\"Three\\\",\\\"Text\\\"],\\\"id\\\":\\\"VHHdzCU0-Y1ylHE\\\"}],\\\"btn\\\":\\\"Metadata\\\"}\", \"access\": \"shared\" } ] Card.PowerUpData [ { \"id\": \"57f4bffd0a0a813388367a0b\", \"idPlugin\": \"56d5e249a98895a9797bebb9\", \"scope\": \"card\", \"idModel\": \"51478f6ce7d2d11751005681\", \"value\": \"{\\\"fields\\\":{\\\"VHHdzCU0-ROR8bF\\\":\\\"4\\\",\\\"VHHdzCU0-ITIYAU\\\":\\\"nothing to see here\\\",\\\"VHHdzCU0-dE8xFw\\\":\\\"2016-11-15T12:00:00+13:00\\\",\\\"VHHdzCU0-o8TMjq\\\":true,\\\"VHHdzCU0-Y1ylHE\\\":3}}\", \"access\": \"shared\" } ] If you stare at this data long enough, and through squinty eyes, you’ll be able to see the pattern: The Board.PowerUps property give us the data to build the CustomFieldsPowerUp instance from the last section. The Board.PowerUpData property defines the fields and the text that appears on the button inside a card. Each field has and ID (id), a name (n), and a data type (t). Dropdown fields also have a property that defines the available options (o). The Card.PowerUpData property defines the field data for that card. Note that numbers, text, and dates all come in as text, which booleans show as bool and dropdown data appears as an integer indicating the index of the selected option. So all we have to do is link up the field definitions with the field data. To start, we model the data. this models the Board.PowerUpData data. public class CustomFieldsSettings { public string ButtonText { get; private set; } public IEnumerable&lt;CustomFieldDefinition&gt; Fields { get; private set; } ... I have some JSON serialization details as well. } This models each field definition. public class CustomFieldDefinition : IJsonSerializable { internal string Id { get; private set; } public string Name { get; private set; } public FieldType Type { get; private set; } public bool ShowBadge { get; private set; } public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; DropdownOptions { get; private set; } ... more JSON serialization stuff. } This models the data for a field. public class CustomFieldData { internal string Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; internal set; } public FieldType Type { get; internal set; } public string Value { get; internal set; } } To get the data (in a convenient fashion) we create a couple extension methods: one that works on boards and one on cards. public static class CustomFieldExtensions { private static readonly JsonSerializer Serializer = new JsonSerializer(); public static CustomFieldsSettings CustomFieldsSettings(this Board board) { CustomFieldsPowerUp.Register(); var data = board.PowerUpData.FirstOrDefault(d =&gt; d.PluginId == CustomFieldsPowerUp.PluginId); if (data == null) return null; var json = JsonValue.Parse(data.Value); var settings = Serializer.Deserialize&lt;CustomFieldsSettings&gt;(json); return settings; } public static IEnumerable&lt;CustomFieldData&gt; CustomFields(this Card card) { CustomFieldsPowerUp.Register(); var data = card.PowerUpData.FirstOrDefault(d =&gt; d.PluginId == CustomFieldsPowerUp.PluginId); if (data == null) return null; This will return null if the power-up isn't registered. var powerUp = card.Board.TryGetPowerUp(); if (powerUp == null) return null; var json = JsonValue.Parse(data.Value); var fieldData = json.Object.TryGetObject(\"fields\").Select(d =&gt; new CustomFieldData { Id = d.Key, Value = d.Value.Type == JsonValueType.String ? d.Value.String : d.Value.ToString() }); var fieldSettings = card.Board.CustomFieldsSettings(); fieldData = fieldSettings.Fields.Join(fieldData, f =&gt; f.Id, d =&gt; d.Id, (f, d) =&gt; { d.Name = f.Name; d.Type = f.Type; return d; }); return fieldData; } } NOTE The TryGetPowerUp() method is an extension on the board that caches the power-up per board. It just helps reduces the number of calls. Now the client can simply call card.CustomFields() to get all of the custom field data. Ideally other power-up implementations will follow the same basic concept: creating a PowerUpBase derivative and extension methods to access the data. The hard part is figuring out the data."

NOTE Once upon a time, I had created Manatee.Trello.NewtonsoftJson. But through several complexities of the Trello API contract, I didn’t feel I was enough of a Json.Net wizard to tackle these, so I dropped it. ANOTHER NOTE If you consider yourself strong in the ways of Newtonsoft’s Json.Net, please feel free to tackle this library and publish it yourself. If you prefer to use a different JSON serializer, the method is similar to that of using your own REST provider. In the Manatee.Trello.Json namespace, you will find a bunch of interfaces, all of which must be implemented. Two will be wrappers for the serializer itself, one will be a factory responsible for creating instances of all of the DTO interfaces, while the others will be concrete implementations for the various object types which Manatee.Trello requests through the REST provider. ISerializer IDeserializer - A distinction between serializer and deserializer functionality has been made for ultimate compatiblity. In most cases, they will be the same object, however exposing this functionality in this way allows Manatee.Trello to support the case that your preferred serializer uses separate objects or that you prefer different libraries to provide this functionality. (And for you software design nuts out there, it support Interface Segregation: the I in SOLID.) IJsonFactory - All of the objects in Manatee.Trello use the JSON objects for data contexts. This factory provides a mechanism for the internals to create instances of those JSON objects. IPickAnEntity - There are quite a few entity interfaces for which you will need to provide functionality. Furthermore, the serializer and deserializer will be called using these interfaces, so you’ll need to ensure that your implementation of IDeserializer is configured properly to create instances of your entity implementations when the entity interface is supplied as the type. (For example, if IJsonCard is requested by Manatee.Trello, your deserializer will need to know to create an instance of your MyJsonCard class which implements IJsonCard.) Once all of the interfaces have been implemented, you can configure Manatee.Trello to use your serializer by setting the Serializer and Deserializer properties on the TrelloServiceConfiguration class as shown above. public class MyJsonSerializerWrapper : ISerializer, IDeserializer { ... } public class MyJsonFactory : IJsonFactory { ... } public static void Main() { ... var serializer = new MyJsonSerializerWrapper(); TrelloConfiguration.Serializer = serializer; TrelloConfiguration.Deserializer = serializer; TrelloConfiguration.JsonFactory = new MyJsonFactory(); ... } To aid in deciding which properties should and should not be serialized, three non-functional attributes have been created and placed on all of the JSON interface properties: JsonDeserializeAttribute - Indicates that the property should be deserialized if a value is present. JsonSerializeAttribute - Indicates that a property should be serialized if a value is present. Also exposes an IsRequired boolean property to indicate whether Trello requires this property. JsonSpecialSerializationAttribute - Indicates that Trello expects special serialization for a given property. Refer to the Trello API documentation for more information regarding these properties. That’s it. Manatee.Trello will now use your JSON serializer through the wrappers you have provided."

						"content": "Manatee.Trello has no default REST provider. However, two additional Nuget packages Manatee.Trello.RestSharp and Manatee.Trello.WebApi are available which provide compatible REST providers. Manatee.Trello.RestSharp is backed by (you guessed it) RestSharp. There have been some issues with the .Net 4.5+ versions, so it’s suggested you don’t use this one unless you are using .Net 4.0 or earlier. Manatee.Trello.WebApi is backed by the ASP.Net WebApi libraries. Only .Net 4.5+ is supported for this library. If you would like to use a different REST client, you will have to build the provider yourself. The Manatee.Trello.Rest namespace contains a number of interfaces which must be implemented in order to use your preferred REST provider. IRestClient - This interface defines methods used to make RESTful calls. Its implementation will serve as a wrapper for your preferred REST provider. IRestClientProvider - This interface defines methods required to create an instance of IRestClient. IRestRequest - This interface defines properties and methods required to make RESTful requests. Its implementation serves as a wrapper for your REST provider’s request objects. IRestRequestProvider - This interface defines methods required to generate IRequest objects used to make RESTful calls. Its implementation will be exposed by your IRestClientProvider implementation. IRestResponse - Defines properties required for objects returned by RESTful calls. Its implmentation serves as a wrapper for your REST provider’s response objects. IRestResponse - Extends IRestResponse to add a typed Data property. Once you have your implementations, set the RestRequestProvider property on the IRestClientProvider to the IRestRequestProvider implementation, then set the RestClientProvider property on the TrelloServiceConfiguration class to the IRestClientProvider implementation. public class MyRestRequestProvider : IRestRequestProvider { ... } public class MyRestClientProvider : IRestClientProvider { ... } public static void Main() { ... var clientProvider = new MyRestClientProvider(); var requestProvider = new MyRestRequestProvider(); clientProvider.RestRequestProvider = requestProvider; TrelloConfiguration.RestClientProvider = clientProvider; ... } That’s it. Manatee.Trello will now call your REST provider through the wrappers you have provided. Note: If your REST provider allows using a custom JSON serializer, it is suggested that you code your IRestClientProvider implementation to be configurable through the use of the TrelloServiceConfiguration class. I have provded a serializer implementation backed by Manatee.Json. See the JSON Serializer section of this wiki for more details on using a custom JSON serializer. Error handling Manatee.Trello is designed to expect exceptions from the REST provider it is given. This means that your REST client wrapper implementation (or the client itself) should throw exceptions when receiving invalid data."

						"title": "Webhooks",
						"category": "",
						"url": " /4-v2/Webhooks/",
						"content": "As an alternative to simply letting entities expire and refresh when they are referenced, the developer has the option of using webhooks to listen for notifications from Trello.com. Webhooks are subscriptions to changes for specific entities. When an entity is altered outside of Manatee.Trello, an HTML POST message will be sent by Trello to a URI that the developer specifies which contains an Action describing what occurred. Manatee.Trello can interpret these Actions and apply any changes to affected entities. It should be noted that this does not automatically disable the default update mechanism. Creating webhooks Registering webhooks has been made simple through one of the Webhook&lt;T&gt; constructors which takes an object implementing the ICanWebhook interface. Like the constructors for the other objects, the second constructor on the Webhook&lt;T&gt; class takes an ID and downloads the data for a webhook that has already been created. var member = new Member(\"myusername\"); var webhook = new Webook&lt;Member&gt;(member, \"http: myurl.com inbox \"); The URI which is passed in must be set up to receive POST messages. Beyond that, the only thing to do is take the messasge body as a string and pass it on to the Webhook class’ ProcessNotification() static method. Manatee.Trello will do the rest. NOTE: In the example above, the member is cached upon creation. If a message is received for an entity which has not been downloaded, there is no change. NOTE: Only entities are updated automatically. Collections (e.g. the Cards property on the List entity) are not affected. Working with webhooks There are several properties on the webhook object which can be edited in order to modify the behavior of webhooks. CallbackUrl - Changes the callback URL to which Trello will send notification messages. Description - Changes an informational description of the webhook. Entity - Changes the entity to which the webhook listens. It should be noted that since the Webhook&lt;T&gt; class is generic, it will be strongly typed to the same kind of entity for which it was created. This is a requirement imposed by Manatee.Trello, not Trello’s API. IsActive - Exposes the ability to temporarily disable notifications for the webhook. When disabled, Trello will not send notifications. Webhooks also expose a Delete() method. This will permanently delete the webhook from Trello."
