Fixes issue for webhook processing where the property list provided by the event were inaccurate.  Also resolves an issue of updating cached entities with potentially stale data downloaded from `Action`s that indicated past activities.  **As a result, `Action.Data` and `Notification.Data` no longer use cached entities.**
